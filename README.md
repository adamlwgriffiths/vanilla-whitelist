# vanilla-whitelist
Whitelist for [Vanilla Chrome extension](https://github.com/laktak/vanilla-chrome).

Contains domains that are used to auto-log you in, and nothing more.

This will help reduce, but not eliminate, tracking through cookies.

Due to the nature of some services authentication mechanisms (Google Gmail, Amazon AWS),
the domain must be listed as a wildcard (*.google.com, *.amazon.com).
This will mean you are open to being tracked to some degree on these websites.
